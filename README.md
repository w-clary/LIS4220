About the project:
In this endeavor, I analyzed Denver's vehicle-related crime and ticketing data by using OpenRefine for filtering, cleaning, and standardizing over 150,000 records from the city's open data portal to identify patterns in parking enforcement, vehicle theft, damage, and break-ins across different neighborhoods. I successfully transformed cryptic offense codes into plain language descriptions, standardized dates and addresses, and prepared the final dataset with complete spatial and temporal information that can be easily mapped to show when and where vehicle-related incidents occur throughout Denver to provide information on safe parking.

About the course:
LIS 4220 Data Curation explores research data management and curation in the digital age, addressing how the proliferation of data-generating technologies across academic disciplines creates both opportunities and challenges. Students learn the complete data lifecycle, from creation through preservation, with emphasis on developing practical skills in data management planning, documentation, standardization, and metadata application. The curriculum responds to increasing governmental mandates for improved data curation and explores how information professionals can lead collaborative initiatives with researchers and technical specialists to solve critical data challenges. By course completion, students understand data curation principles, are familiar with emerging practices in data citation and publication, and are prepared to contribute an information science perspective to the growing field of research data management.
